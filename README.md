# DubstepBombPrank
## What does it do?
* It waits for a certain period of time (Hence the name "Bomb") and plays 2 dubstep songs + 1 Future Bass song.<br>
* When the music is playing ,the volume is set to **MAX**.<br>
* **TARGET COMPUTER WILL NOT BE ABLE TO REDUCE THE VOLUME :smile:** <br>*Note: Volume controls return to normal after the songs are done playing*
## Ok..What so great about it?
* **The program will run everytime that computer turns on** :smile:<br>
*So pretty much everytime they turn on computer, they have to experience EXTREME EAR-RAPE :laughing:*
* The Icon is from a Halo game so you can trick your friends that they are downloading a game.<br>

## Requirements
* About 25 MB of storage
* A Windows computer
<br><br>
## What are the different EXE files?
IM GLAD YOU ASKED !!<br>
*They all are the same thing except for the last one*

* The `1bomb.exe` file waits for 1 minute before running
* The  `10bomb.exe` file waits for 10 minutes before running
* The Last one is **INSTANT** but it plays the EDM song first then the 2 DUBSTEP songs (The nice version I guess :laughing:)
