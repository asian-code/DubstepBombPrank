# DubstepBombPrank
### THIS PROGRAM DOES NOT HARM THE COMPUTER IN ANY WAY 
The program blast Dubstep and a EDM song at full volume everytime that PC starts up.
### NOTE: PLEASE MAKE SURE THE PERSON YOUR DOING THIS TO IS NOT WEARING HEADPHONES TO PREVENT EAR DAMAGE

## What does it do?
* It waits for a period of time (Hence the name "Bomb") and plays 2 dubstep songs + 1 Future Bass song.<br>
* When the music is playing ,the volume is set to **MAX**.<br>
* **TARGET COMPUTER WILL NOT BE ABLE TO REDUCE THE VOLUME :smile:** <br>*Note: Volume controls return to normal after the songs are done playing*
## Ok..What so great about it?
* **The program will run everytime that computer turns on** :smile:<br>
*So pretty much everytime they turn on computer, their room **EXPLODES** with dubstep and they have to experience **EXTREME EAR-RAPE** :laughing:.....unless they really like dubstep then the prank is useless lol*
* The Icon is from a Halo game so you can trick your friends that they are downloading a game.<br>
* There is no window that pops up for the target to close the app.

## Requirements
* About 25 MB of storage
* A Windows computer
<br><br>
## How to run
1. Pick a version of the prank (Pick the exe file that fit your needs)
2. Run the EXE file on the target computer.
3. RUN FAR AWAY AND WATCH YOUR FRIEND CONFUSED AF TRYING TO STOP THE SONG FROM PLAYING :laughing:

## What are the different EXE files?
IM GLAD YOU ASKED !!<br>
*They all are the same thing except for the last one*

* The `1bomb.exe` file waits for 1 minute before running (2 DUBSTEP first then the EDM)
* The  `10bomb.exe` file waits for 10 minutes before running. (2 DUBSTEP first then the EDM)<br>
*This is good for running on friends PC and walk away before your friend comes back to their computer*
* The Last one is **INSTANT** but it plays the EDM song first then the 2 DUBSTEP songs (The nice version I guess :laughing:)
